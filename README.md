gtask
=====

List up google tasks from a command line.

# Introduction

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/gtask/install/install.sh| sh

This will install a script to `/usr/bin`
and you may be asked root password.

If you want to install other directory, do like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/gtask/install/install.sh|  prefix=~/usr/local/ sh

Or, simply download a script and set where you like.
